# ASCII-art-generator
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. In standard ASCII-encoded data, there are unique values for 128 alphabetic, numeric or special additional characters and control codes.
In this project we have used ASCII characters strings to trace the image using pillow and opencv libraries of python language.

Initially I made map of ASCII characters and then stored them in their increasing order of brightness and then using opencv libraries I did the project.

This is an example of image of ASCII characters.
